placement of pins

   - resolve vertical pins
   - resolve horizontal pins

a board is divided in 4 regions: "north", "east", "south", "west". Within each region the placement is done with a placement resolver, either horizontally or vertically.

The problem right now is the order, as you saw. I probably need to add a position index, since the order of an array feels not strong enough, and the placement resolver can either work from left-to-right, or right-to-left.
